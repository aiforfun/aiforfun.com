This is a static website, we are using it for announcing our up-comming features or for demo purpose.
AIForFun is focusing on AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning). 
We are newbies of these areas, but during the self-researching we also want to create something fun and useful.

Our methodology (Code first before any discussion):
1. Create a description/illustration issue.
2. Create a prototype if possible.
3. Code something.
4. Invite other members to join and contribute.

Host: AWS S3
CI/CD: Travis CI (In progress)

Deployment Process in 2 simple steps:
1. Commit code to GitHub
2. Travis CI will build & deploy directly to AWS S3.
